The SAV project is a Java-based sorting system designed to handle both characters and numbers, offering a versatile solution for various sorting needs.
The system allows users to specify sorting algorithms through command line arguments, supporting options like bubble sort, insertion sort, and selection sort.
Additionally, it provides choices for list types, sorting order, data input methods, and pause intervals in milliseconds, enhancing its flexibility and adaptability. 
The "Sort Utils" interface plays a crucial role in defining the structure and behavior of the sorting operations, ensuring consistency and ease of implementation.
Through its comprehensive design, the SAV project aims to deliver an efficient and user-friendly sorting solution for diverse applications.
